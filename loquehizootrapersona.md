1st Prompt:

Create one html file for a luxury smartwatch page using Three.js, Anime.js and Tailwind. Make a 3D watch model, a dark textured overlay with a round hole showing the watch on beige, and animate header and big numbers to slide in when page loads.

key points:
- 3D watch: cylinder case, strap, buttons, made in Three.js, not just an imag
- layout: full screen dark texture layer with a circular cutout centered, beige background behind hole
- animation: use Anime.js for better animations

3rd Prompt:

Turn the single screen into a multi section scroll site. When user scrolls, animate the 3D watch to move and rotate to match each section. Keep the 3D canvas and background fixed while text scrolls over them, only the watch moves

- fixed canvas: position the canvas fixed so page scrolls over it
- scroll choreography: tie scroll position to watch position and rotation, snap or smooth interpolate
- only animate watch transforms, avoid re-rendering heavy things if not needed
